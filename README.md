## Project Overview

The data in the two doppler_data subdirectories, was collected using a 10.525 GHz CW Radar (the HB100), mounted to a bike. Several scenarios were modeled, most with the bike, followed by a runner, accelerating aways from a wall.
Some scenarios feature only a runner, running toward the stationary bike, and others with just the bike accelerating away from a wall.

In order to interact with our data, or see some of the analysis and processing algorithms we developed, take a look at the process_doppler_data.ipynb notebook. It has some limited commentary that walks through the main steps we took, with some additional attempts at training our cost function at the end.
